# ChatBot

This repository contains a chatbot built using Flask, LangChain, and Qdrant. The chatbot is designed to answer questions based on the provided content by leveraging Qdrant as a vector database for efficient retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Features
- **Flask Backend:** Lightweight and efficient API for handling user queries.
- **LangChain Integration:** Enables structured retrieval and natural language processing.
- **Qdrant Vector Database:** Stores and retrieves embeddings for semantic search.
- **Contextual Responses:** The chatbot provides answers based on the stored content.

## Usage
1. Uploading PDF Files:
   . The frontend allows users to upload PDF files.
   . These PDFs are processed, and their content is stored in the Qdrant vector database.
   
2. Asking Questions:

   . Once a document is uploaded, users can ask questions related to its content.
   . The chatbot retrieves the most relevant text segments and generates responses based on them.
   
3. Example Workflow:
